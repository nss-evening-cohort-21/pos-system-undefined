## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is an employee at a restuarant. 
- They have cumstomers who need to have their orders taken down so that they can get the food they order.
- The problem this app solves for them is that it allows the user to manage orders that come from the customers of the restuarant and generates a total revenue for the restuarant. 

## Features 
-When a new Order is created an object will be created within a firebase database and will then be seen on the DOM.
- These newly created orders are editable deletable and searchable. (if an order is deleted all associated items will be deleted as well)
- The orders are now cabable of having items attached to them. These items are also editable, deletable, and searchable.
- All changes made to the orders and items will be reflected in the firebase database. 
- Orders will have the ability to be closed. Once an order is closed it will be included in total revenue calculations.
